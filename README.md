# CuPhyR

This repository contains the R package CuPhyR (Custom Phyloseq R package). 
The package gives customized shortcuts for tidyverse and phyloseq for interacting with 
phyloseq class objects generated with the Phyloseq package by Paul J. McMurdie (github.com/joey711/phyloseq).
Since it is tested and developed with ASV data from the dada2 package by Bejamin Callahan (benjjneb/dada2), 
the function names are referring to ASVs instead of 'taxa' (phyloseq terminology). 

The package is in early development. Use at your own risk, feedback welcome!
