Description: This package contains functions that offer customized shortcuts for interacting with phyloseq class objects generated with the Phyloseq package by Paul J. McMurdie (github.com/joey711/phyloseq). Since it is tested and developed with ASV data from the dada2 package by Bejamin Callahan (benjjneb/dada2), the function names are referring to ASVs instead of 'taxa' (phyloseq terminology). Use at your own risk, feedback welcome!
